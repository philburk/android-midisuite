A synthesizer that uses a very simple sawtooth oscillator and an
ADSR envelope. This app is intended to demonstrate how to write
a synthesizer. Our goal is to encourage developers to use this as 
a starting point for writing better sounding synthesizers.

This sample also demonstrates how to add MIDI support to an application.
