Privacy Policy for MIDI BLE Connect

* This app does NOT collect any user data.
* This app does not display ads.
* The app requires LOCATION permissions because it uses BlueTooth. Bluetooth can detect devices near your location.

This app allows you to connect a MIDI peripheral, such as a keyboard or synthesizer, to your Android device.
The peripheral will then be available for apps on your phone to exchange MIDI music messages such as NoteOn or PitchBend.
