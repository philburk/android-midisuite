Tool for pairing a Bluetooth MIDI device with an Android device.

Launch app, click "Bluetooth Scan" button, 
then select a BLE-MIDI device.

TO use the device, exit this tool by hitting the Home button, 
not the Back button. Then you can use the BLE-MIDI device just like 
you would a USB or virtual MIDI device.
